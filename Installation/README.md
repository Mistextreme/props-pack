*FiveM's biggest prop pack* 😋

---

## 🐛 Installation

1. **Extract**  
   Unzip `the food pack` and `animations` into a new folder or wherever you want, or directly into your server's resources. Ensure in your `server.cfg`

2. **Item Images**  
   Place the provided item images into your inventory's `images` folder.
   
3. **Inventory Setup**  
   Add the items to your inventory script. (We've included a config for ox_inventory; it's easy to convert for any custom inventory.)

## 📈 Updates

- New props will be added regularly.
- New animations will be released frequently.
- I have not done the images yet and will do them over time.
